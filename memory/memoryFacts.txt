Stack segement vs Heap segement

Stack                                                               Heap                            
faster to access                                               Slower to access
Try using Stack as much as possible                            Heap should be used only when lasrge chunk of memory is requird or scope requires to be more.
Stack segement generally is 2 MB
It takes one cpu instruction, hence very fast
